## Meeting notes of 23/06/2016

1. [TODO] Find out which weather features are used in previous works
2. [POSSIBLE] Take into account the domain when doing the pairings of weather and bicycle readings, before might be more representative than after.
	* Can this be improved with a smoothing function?
3. [TODO ]Fill the gap every 5 min, this is given by the precision of the input data
4. [TODO] Would be helpful to average inactivity time of stations and compare high and low priority
